## Introduction
This analysis will review our findings from EDA of the combined beers and breweries data sets, and a KNN classification model for categorizing a beer as Ale or IPA. We used machine learning to replace the missing data and statistical backgroud to explore the findings. We analyzed the data sets on median IBU, median ABV, and style by region to find out what we could do to improve for the company, Budweiser.

## Conclusion
There may be an opportunity for Budweiser to consider increasing their ABV - perhaps in only certain states; or possibly introducing a new product that puts a spin on the classic beverage, to meet consumer preferences in places such as Colorado and Oregon, the states with the highest ABV and IBU respectively.
